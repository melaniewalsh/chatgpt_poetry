# Does ChatGPT Have a Poetic Style?

This repository includes code that we used to generate and analyze poems by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for the following paper:

Melanie Walsh, Anna Preus, Elizabeth Gronski, ["Does ChatGPT Have a Poetic Style?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15299), *Computational Humanities Research Conference* (CHR 2024). 

The public domain poems that we used as a comparison corpus can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/maria-antoniak/poetry-eval) related to prior work. We are planning to share our GPT-generated poetry corpus at a later stage.
